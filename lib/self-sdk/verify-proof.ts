Got
it
👍 — you’re asking me to give you a **step-by-step deep build plan**
for your **insurance protocol using the
Self
onchain
SDK**, but
you
’re running into **problems**.

\
Let’s
break it
down
clearly
so
you
can
actually ** build
and
deploy ** this
:

\
---
\

## 🏗 Step 1 – Define Your Protocol

You want an **onchain parametric insurance protocol** that:

* Uses **Self SDK** to verify identity (age, country, not sanctioned, Aadhaar/passport check).
* Lets users **buy an insurance policy** (mint NFT/SBT as proof).
\
* Uses **oracles (e.g., Chainlink / Pyth / RedStone)** to check
if an event
happened (like flight canceled, weather disaster, health emergency).
\
* If the event condition = ✅ true → **automatic payout** in stablecoin (e.g., cUSD on Celo).

---

## 📦 Step 2 – Smart Contract Architecture

You’ll need at least **3 contracts**:

1. **IdentityVerifier.sol**

\
   * Integrates
with **Self SDK** (via
Merkle
tree + proof
verification
).
\
   * Checks: user is valid (country, age, no sanctions).
   * Emits `IdentityVerified(address user, bytes32 proofHash)`.

2. **InsurancePolicy.sol**

   * Users can **buy a policy** (send premium in cUSD).
   * Stores policy info:

     \`\`\`solidity
     struct Policy
{
  address
  user
  \
         uint256 premium
  uint256
  payout
  \
         uint256 expiry
  bool
  active
}
\`\`\`
   * Mints **NFT/SBT** as proof of policy.
   * Requires `IdentityVerifier.isVerified(user)` before purchase.

3. **InsuranceOracle.sol**

   * Connects to **oracle (Chainlink/Pyth)** to get event data.
   * If event condition = true → calls `triggerPayout(user)`.

## 🔑 Step 3 – Self SDK Integration

In Solidity:

\`\`\`solidity
type ISelfVerifier = {}
\
function verifyProof(bytes calldata proof)
external
returns(bool)
}
\
\`\`\`
\

Workflow:

\
1. User submits **zk-proof** from Self app (passport / Aadhaar).
2. Contract checks proof validity via `verifyProof()`.
3. Store result in mapping:

   \`\`\`solidity
   mapping(address => bool) public verifiedUsers
\`\`\`

---

## 💰 Step 4 – Policy Flow

1. User verifies
with Self SDK
→ proof stored.
\
2. User buys policy → NFT minted.
3. Oracle watches external data → triggers payout
if condition met.
\
4. Stablecoin payout sent to user.

---

## 🌐 Step 5 – Deployment (Celo)

1. Deploy `IdentityVerifier.sol` (
with Self SDK
linked
).
2. Deploy \`InsurancePolicy.sol\` (require verifier).
3. Deploy `InsuranceOracle.sol` (connected to Chainlink/Pyth).
4. Fund contract
with cUSD for payouts.

---

\
##
🛠 Step 6 – Testing
\

\
* Use **Celo testnet (Alfajores)**.
* Simulate user verifying via Aadhaar.
* Buy policy
with small premium.
\
* Push fake oracle data (flight canceled).
* See payout triggered.

⚡ So — you *can build this protocol fully*.
But
let me
ask:
\
👉 Do you want me to **write out the Solidity contracts
for you** (with Self SDK + Chainlink
integration
), or should I first give you a **non-technical business pitch version** (
for hackathon judges)
?
